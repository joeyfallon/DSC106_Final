            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The <b>National Basketball Association</b> "NBA" <b>Most Valuable Player</b> "MVP" award is exclusive to only the best of the best in the league.
                We wanted to see if we could constitute what the "best" actually means--or if
                there's a clear, cut candidate that stands above everyone else in terms of production.
                The MVP award is not just given to anyone, and we would like to see if our data would
                point us in the direction of a particular candidate, being either Lebron James or Giannis Antetokounmpo.
                However, due to the unforseen circumstances, the NBA season has been suspended indefinitely so the 
                current data we have now may not be representative of what the data would be in choosing the NBA MVP. The 
                race this year has been very close, but in our research we think the award is already skewed towards one person.
                So let's investigate further, shall we?

            <h2>What Makes A League MVP?</h2>
            <p>
                The <b>Most Valuable Player</b> award by definition, is a player who exceeds the NBA league average for 
                every player statistic, and ultimately contributes most towards their team winning. The NBA league average is as follows:
                <b>PPG</b>: 10.2, <b>RPG</b>: 4.1, <b>APG</b>, 2.0, <b>SPG</b>: 0.5, <b>BPG</b>: 0.4, <b>PER</b>: 13.2. So in recent years,
                the top-performing player on the team with the most wins is usually selected as the MVP. However, that is not always the case
                and that's where we can offer more insight.

            <h2>What's The Story Here?</h2>
            <p>
                Lebron James has had a "GOAT" of a career. Anyone who thinks otherwise clearly has bias because if there's one thing
                you can't argue with, it's pure, objective statistics. Lebron is currently in his 17th year in the NBA and has won
                3 NBA championships, 3 NBA Finals MVP awards, 4 NBA MVP awards, and the list goes on. Lebron has had a career average of
                27.1 PPG, 7.4 RPG and APG, 1.6 SPG, and 0.8 BPG and there is no doubt that when it's all said and done, The "King" will be
                inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame and potentially known as the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Giannis Antetokounmpo first entered the NBA, he was not immediately a star player who could dominate his opponents with ease.
                Giannis took his time to develop; when you compare his photos from his rookie year to now, you would not even be able to recognize 
                that they're the same person. Giannis is currently in his 7th year in the NBA and most will argue that he is not even at his prime.
                It is a pure testament to the work Giannis has put into his skills see the current result we have now of him. 
                Giannis has won the NBA MVP award once and boasts a career average of 20.0 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, and 1.3 BPG. Giannis's team
                this year set the record for making the playoffs the fastest in history, having a record of 48-8 to secure the number one seed in the East.
                Giannis will only continue to get better and the game of basketball is priviledged to have seen such growth from the "Greek Freak."
            </p>
            <p>
                So from what we know so far, Lebron has had a much longer career than Giannis so it's not really fair to compare the two's accomplishments.
