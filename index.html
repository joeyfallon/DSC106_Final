            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                    The <b>National Basketball Association</b> "NBA" <b>Most Valuable Player</b> "MVP" award is exclusive to only the best of the best in the league.
                We wanted to see if we could constitute what the "best" actually means--or if
                there's a clear, cut candidate that stands above everyone else in terms of production.
                The MVP award is not just given to anyone, and we would like to see if our data would
                point us in the direction of a particular candidate, being either LeBron James or Giannis Antetokounmpo.
                However, due to the unforseen circumstances, the NBA season has been suspended indefinitely so the 
                current data we have now may not be representative of what the data would be in choosing the NBA MVP. The 
                race this year has been very close so let's investigate further, shall we?

            <h2>What Makes A League MVP?</h2>
            <p>
                    The <b>Most Valuable Player</b> award by definition, is a player who exceeds the NBA league average for 
                every player statistic, and ultimately contributes most towards their team winning. The NBA league average is as follows:
                <b>PPG</b>: 10.2, <b>RPG</b>: 4.1, <b>APG</b>, 2.0, <b>SPG</b>: 0.5, <b>BPG</b>: 0.4, <b>PER</b>: 13.2. So in recent years,
                the top-performing player on the team with the most wins is usually selected as the MVP. However, that is not always the case
                and that's where we can offer more insight.

        <div id="tellTheStory">
            <h2>What's The Story Here?</h2>
            <p>
                    LeBron James has had a <b>"GOAT"</b> of a career. Anyone who thinks otherwise clearly has bias because
                you can't argue with objective statistics, accolades and merit. LeBron is currently in his 17th year in the NBA and has won
                <b>3 NBA championships</b>, <b>3 NBA Finals MVP awards</b>, <b>4 NBA MVP awards</b>, and the list goes on. LeBron has had a career average of
                27.1 PPG, 7.4 RPG and APG, 1.6 SPG, and 0.8 BPG and there is no doubt that when it's all said and done, The <b>"King"</b> will be
                inducted into the <b>Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</b> and potentially known as the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.
            </p>
            <p>
                    When Giannis Antetokounmpo first entered the NBA, he was not immediately a star player who could dominate his opponents with ease.
                Giannis took his time to develop; when you compare his photos from his rookie year to now, you would not even be able to recognize 
                that they're the same person. Giannis is currently in his 7th year in the NBA and most will argue that he is <b>not even</b> at his prime.
                It is a <b>pure testament</b> to the work Giannis has put into his skills see the current result we have now of him. 
                Giannis has won the <b>NBA MVP award</b> once and boasts a career average of 20.0 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 4.3 APG, 1.2 SPG, and 1.3 BPG. Giannis's team
                this year set the record for making the playoffs the <b>fastest in history</b>, having a record of <b>48-8</b> to secure the number one seed in the East.
                Giannis will only continue to get better and the game of basketball is <b>priviledged</b> to have seen such growth from the <b>"Greek Freak."</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                    So from what we know so far, LeBron has had a much longer career than Giannis so it's not really fair to compare the two's accomplishments.
                Let's observe the curent NBA season of 2019-2020 to compare LeBron and Giannis along with their respective teams a little closer then.

        <h2>Contextual Analysis</h2>
        <p>
                Prior to the shut-down of the NBA season due to COVID-19, the Lakers and the Bucks had faced each other just twice. 
            In their first encounter, the Bucks had beaten the Lakers 111-104. This was earlier in the season where the teams have not quite "gel-ed" with each other.  
            In their second encounter, the Lakers beat the Bucks 113-103. This was very recent and speaks more of the team's potential playoff performance. 
        </p>
        <p>
                From the line chart above, we can see that the Lakers had rivaled the Bucks up until December. 
            In December the Lakers faced a 4 game losing streak while the Bucks continued on their win streak.
            It goes to show that the NBA is a truly competitive league because the Lakers lost to the bottom seeds in each conference. 
            These losses set them considerably behind the Bucks but still good enough to be #1 in the Western Conference (arguably the more competitive conference). 
            While both teams are leading within their respective conferences and divisions, the Bucks took a clear lead in overall wins.

        <h2>Contextual Analysis</h2>
        <p>
                Looking at the stacked bar chart above, we can compare LeBron and Giannis' total statistics easily.
            While Giannis is entering the prime of his career, LeBron is arguably past his peak with his NBA debut nearing 2 decades ago.
            Although LeBron trails slightly in overall points, he greatly overcomes Giannis's overall assist statistic.
            This means that LeBron is forfeiting padding his own point statistics to make more plays for his team (as any point guard should). 
            Keep in mind that LeBron is currently averaging the most assists he's ever averaged.

                In observing the PER pie chart, Giannis claims a significantly higher PER (per minute performance) than LeBron. 
            This PER is currently #1 in the NBA and historically places him at #7 on the leaderboard. 
            Earlier in the season, Giannis actually had a 32.35 PER, which is actually the highest PER ever recorded in NBA history.
            If the NBA season were to continue and Giannis kept at his productive pace, one can only speculate the records Giannis could have broken.
            However, we have to acknowledge LeBron for keeping that same consistency when it comes to his individual stats. To do what he does at 
            year 17 at 36 years old is absolutely un-heard of.

        <h2>What's Our Final Takeaway?</h2>
        <p>
                LeBron, at this state of his career, has probably another 3-4 dominant years left in him before he's simply too old to play aggressively or explosively without risk for injury.
            Keeping in mind that the MVP award is a regular season award, it would make sense for LeBron to not try as hard to have individual success when he has his young teammate Anthony Davis,
            a very proficient and efficient scorer--which is why LeBron is averaging so many assists (along with high-volume 3-PT shooters on his team). LeBron is most likely saving his energy
            for the upcoming (now delayed) playoffs. For LeBron to establish himself as one of the greatest players to ever play the game of basketball, he would definitely need more championships.

                Holistically, the Lakers, as well as LeBron, have more to prove following the tragic passing of Laker legend, Kobe Bryant. Sure, Giannis is statistically a better player at the moment (still arguable),
            but a LeBron MVP makes for a more emotional conclusion to the year following Kobe's death. However, looking at our data visualizations, if the season were to end today, Giannis
            would most likely be the reigning NBA MVP for a second consecutive year.
